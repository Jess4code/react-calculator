# React Calculator
This project is just a simple calculator that does basic calculations built using ReactJS.

## Credits
This project was created as a part of [Web Dev Simplified](https://courses.webdevsimplified.com/) curriculum. Special thanks to Kyle Cook for providing a tutorial and guidance on building this application. The video is posted by [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/@WebDevSimplified) on youtube [The Perfect Beginner React Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgRrrOt0Vr8).

## Notes
This project shows us the reason behind using a reducer "useReducer". Because when you have an app with a little bit more complex state you will face some issues there only using the old good "useState" especially when it comes to passing arguments to the deep nested elements.
